Of course. Visualizing these architectures is a great way to understand their similarities and differences.

Here are the diagrams you requested. First, a general block diagram to conceptually show the architectures, followed by the more detailed MermaidJS diagrams.

### 1. Conceptual Block Diagram

This diagram shows the two main architectural patterns: the standard Transformer architecture used by models like ChatGPT and Gemini, and the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture used by models like Mistral 8x7B.

![Conceptual diagram showing two LLM architectures. The first, labeled 'Standard Architecture (ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen)', shows a linear flow: Input -> Embedding -> Transformer Blocks (repeated) -> Output. The Transformer Block contains a Self-Attention layer and a Feed-Forward Network. The second, labeled 'Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture (Mistral)', shows a similar flow, but the Transformer Block's Feed-Forward Network is replaced by a 'Router' that directs input to one of many 'Expert' Feed-Forward Networks.](https://i.imgur.com/rYmE3vT.png)

**Key Takeaways from the Diagram:**

*   **Standard Architecture (ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen):** Every piece of data (token) that goes through the network is processed by the *same set of weights* in each Transformer block. The path is fixed.
*   **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture (Mistral):** This is the clever part. For each token, a small "Router" network decides which "Expert" sub-network should process it. This means only a fraction of the model's total parameters are used for any single token, making it much faster and more efficient during inference, while still retaining the knowledge of a much larger model.

### 2. MermaidJS Diagrams

Here are the same concepts represented in MermaidJS code, which you can use in Markdown-enabled editors or other tools that support it.

#### A. Standard LLM Architecture (ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen)

This diagram shows the typical flow inside a decoder-only Transformer model. The input is processed through a series of identical blocks, each refining the representation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Standard LLM Architecture (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini)"
        A[Input Text] --> B(Tokenization & Embedding);
        B --> C{Transformer Block 1};
        C --> D{...};
        D --> E{Transformer Block N};
        E --> F(Output Layer / Softmax);
        F --> G[Predicted Next Word];

        subgraph "Inside a Transformer Block"
            H(Self-Attention Mechanism) --> I(Add & Norm);
            I --> J(Feed-Forward Network);
            J --> K(Add & Norm);
        end

        style C fill:#d4e4ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        style D fill:#d4e4ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        style E fill:#d4e4ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    end
```

**Explanation:**
*   **Input Text:** Your prompt.
*   **Tokenization & Embedding:** The text is broken into pieces (tokens) and converted into numerical vectors.
*   **Transformer Blocks:** This is the core of the model. The data passes through many of these blocks (from 1 to N). Each block contains:
    *   **Self-Attention:** Where the model weighs the importance of different tokens relative to each other.
    *   **Feed-Forward Network:** A standard neural network layer that processes the output from the attention mechanism.
*   **Output Layer:** Predicts the most likely next word in the sequence.

#### B. Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture (Mistral)

This diagram highlights the key difference in the MoE model. Notice how the standard "Feed-Forward Network" is replaced by a Router and multiple "Experts".

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "MoE LLM Architecture (e.g., Mistral)"
        A[Input Text] --> B(Tokenization & Embedding);
        B --> C{MoE Transformer Block 1};
        C --> D{...};
        D --> E{MoE Transformer Block N};
        E --> F(Output Layer / Softmax);
        F --> G[Predicted Next Word];

        subgraph "Inside an MoE Transformer Block"
            direction LR
            H(Self-Attention Output) --> Router;
            Router -- Chooses Top-K --> Expert1[Expert FFN 1];
            Router -- ... --> Expert2[Expert FFN 2];
            Router -- ... --> ExpertN[Expert FFN N];
            
            subgraph " "
                direction TB
                Expert1 --> Combine;
                Expert2 --> Combine;
                ExpertN --> Combine((Combine Outputs));
            end
        end

        style C fill:#d2f7d2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        style D fill:#d2f7d2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
        style E fill:#d2f7d2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    end
```

**Explanation:**
*   The overall flow is the same, but the internal structure of the **MoE Transformer Block** is different.
*   Instead of a single Feed-Forward Network (FFN), there is:
    *   A **Router:** A small network that looks at the token and decides which "Experts" are best suited to process it. In Mistral's case, it picks the top 2.
    *   **Multiple Expert FFNs:** A pool of smaller Feed-Forward Networks.
*   The token is only processed by the selected experts (e.g., 2 out of 8), and their outputs are combined. This provides the efficiency gain.
